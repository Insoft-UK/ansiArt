Similar to ASCII art, but utilizing ANSI escape codes to incorporate text color changes, creating what is known as ANSI Art.
This utility is for generating ANSI art code from an image file for use with the **terminal**.

> [!NOTE]
The only image file format currently supported by this utility tool is the Bitmap (BMP) format, with 4-bit, 8-bit color depth.
